## Code Styleguide

* Code submitted should be modular. 
* Add the code in their respective directory only.
* Filename should be same as that of the problem code.
* Currently we are accepting contributions in C, C++, Java and Python but other languages may be considered after a discussion.
* Meaningful comments to explain your code better are welcomed.
* No profanity.
* We have defined [skeleton codes](#samples) for some popular languages below. Please follow them whenever possible.
* Sample skeleton codes are for showing guidelines and indentations only.

## Improving a Dish

* If you feel you can improve upon any added code, feel free to open an issue discussing the improvements.
* The points to be considered for improvement will be the time required by code to pass testcases, easy explanation, etc.

## Samples

#### C

```c
int main() {
    int tc;
    scanf("%d",&tc);
    while (tc--) {
        /*
        your code here;
        */
    }
}
```

#### C++

```c++
int main() {
    int tc;
    cin>>tc;
    while (tc--) {
        /*
        your code here;
        */
    }
}
```

#### Python
```python
def main():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        Your Dish here...
        tc -= 1
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

#### Java
```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner inp = new Scanner(System.in);
        int tc = inp.nextInt();
        while (tc-- != 0) {
            Your code goes here...
        }
    }
}
```
